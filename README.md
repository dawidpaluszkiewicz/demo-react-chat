# Original README
## Install Dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Import Example Project

Import this [project with custom actions](example_project.vf) into your Voiceflow workspace.
It includes custom `account_info`, `calendar` and `video` actions.

## Configure Environment

Follow [these instructions](https://developer.voiceflow.com/reference/project#obtaining-a-dialog-manager-api-key)
to get the Dialog API key for your Voiceflow project.

Write your API key to a `.env.local` file.

```sh
# replace `XXX` with your API key
echo 'VF_DM_API_KEY=XXX` > .env.local
```

### ðŸ›‘ NOT PRODUCTION SAFE ðŸ›‘

This setup is **NOT** the recommended way of authenticating a Web Chat project with the Voiceflow Dialog API.
Using the API key in the browser exposes it to the user and could allow them to make unauthorized requests to the API.

For a production-ready setup, you should publish your Voiceflow assistant and update the options passed to the `useRuntime` hook. You can find your assistant's `projectID` in the code example on the Web Chat Integration page.
[See our docs](https://developer.voiceflow.com/docs/chat-widget) for more information.

```ts
useRuntime({
  verify: { projectID: 'XXX' },
  versionID: 'production',

  // the rest of your options can stay the same
});
```

## Run Dev Server

The demo app will be available locally at <http://127.0.0.1:3006>.

## Live Agent Handoff

To demo this functionality you will need to run a local WebSocket server that will interface with the live agent platform.
The `server/` directory contains a sample server with some basic integrations.
See the [README](server/README.md) for more information.
